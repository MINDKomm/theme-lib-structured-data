# StructuredData

## 2.0.0 â€“ 2019-01-23

* Split logo and social profiles into separate classes to follow how Google advises to do it for the [Logo](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/logo) and the [Social profile](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/social-profile) data types.
* Added support for defining social profiles as an array. The way to do it is now reflected in the README.
* Removed Google+ because Google will shut down the service in the upcoming months.

## 1.0.1 - 2018-11-21

* Fixed error when zip or city was missing.
